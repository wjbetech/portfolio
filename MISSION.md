# Portfolio Website Mission Statement

## Mission

To build a truly personal, unique, and retro-themed portfolio website that is bold, minimalistic, and highly interactive. The site will serve as a living showcase of my work, personality, and creativity as a Software Engineer.

## Core Quirks & Features

1. **Motion & Interactivity:**

   - The site will feature lots of motion, transitions, and interactive elements to create a lively, engaging experience.

2. **My Scottish Fold Cats as Characters:**

   - My two Scottish Fold cats will appear as recurring characters throughout the site:
     - **Maengy (맹):** Black and white tuxedo
     - **Ggong (꽁):** All white
   - They will be integrated into the design and UI as fun, animated mascots.

3. **Interactive Multi-Tab Project Section:**

   - Projects will be showcased in a multi-tabbed, panel-based interface, allowing visitors to explore each project in detail with smooth transitions and interactive content.

4. **Retro Theme (DaisyUI):**

   - The entire app will use DaisyUI's retro theme, enforced regardless of the user's system light/dark preference.

5. **Minimalism & Boldness:**
   - The design will be minimalistic (no shadows), with bold colors, strong typography, and a focus on clarity and fun.

## Technical Foundations

- **Modern Tech Stack:** Vite, TypeScript, React, TailwindCSS, DaisyUI
- **Performance:** Fast, smooth, and responsive
- **Accessibility:** Usable by everyone
- **Open Source:** Clean, maintainable codebase
