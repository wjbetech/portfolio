# Portfolio Website Mission Statement

## Mission

To build a truly personal, unique, and retro-themed portfolio website that is bold, minimalistic, and highly interactive. The site will serve as a living showcase of my work, personality, and creativity as a Software Engineer.

## Core Quirks & Features

1. **Motion & Interactivity:**

   - The site will feature lots of motion, transitions, and interactive elements to create a lively, engaging experience.

   - The overall feel should be fluid, with seamless transitions and delightful micro-interactions throughout.

   - Cute references to my cats should appear in playful, unexpected ways across the site.

2. **My Scottish Fold Cats as Characters:**

   - My two Scottish Fold cats will appear as recurring characters throughout the site:
     - **Maengy (맹):** Black and white tuxedo
     - **Ggong (꽁):** All white
   - They will be integrated into the design and UI as fun, animated mascots.

   - Cat-themed easter eggs, tooltips, or animations should be sprinkled throughout for personality.

3. **Interactive Multi-Tab Project Section:**

   - Projects will be showcased in a multi-tabbed, panel-based interface, allowing visitors to explore each project in detail with smooth transitions and interactive content.

   - This section should be the second main section of the site, immediately after the hero.

4. **Retro Theme (DaisyUI):**

   - The entire app will use DaisyUI's retro theme, enforced regardless of the user's system light/dark preference.

5. **Minimalism & Boldness:**
   - The design will be minimalistic (no shadows), with bold colors, strong typography, and a focus on clarity and fun.

## Page Structure

1. **Hero Section (Top):**

   - Bold, visually striking introduction with a picture of me.
   - Animated effects to highlight my tech stack.
   - Prominent, interactive call-to-action.

2. **Projects Section:**

   - Multi-tab/panel interface for exploring my projects in depth.
   - Each project panel is interactive and visually engaging.

3. **Contact & Career Section:**
   - Ways to get in touch, plus highlights of other features of my career.
   - May include a contact form, social links, and additional fun/cat-themed elements.

**Each section should occupy one full page in height, be fully responsive across all devices, and be built to accessibility standards.**

## Technical Foundations

- **Modern Tech Stack:** Vite, TypeScript, React, TailwindCSS, DaisyUI
- **Performance:** Fast, smooth, and responsive
- **Accessibility:** Usable by everyone
- **Open Source:** Clean, maintainable codebase
