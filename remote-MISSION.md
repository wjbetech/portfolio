# Portfolio Website Mission Statement

## Mission

To create a visually engaging, performant, and accessible portfolio website that showcases my skills, projects, and experience as a Software Engineer. The site will leverage modern web technologies—Vite, TypeScript, React, TailwindCSS, and DaisyUI—to deliver a seamless user experience, responsive design, and a unique personal brand.

## Foundations

- **Modern Tech Stack:** Built with Vite for fast development, TypeScript for type safety, React for component-driven UI, TailwindCSS for utility-first styling, and DaisyUI for beautiful, accessible components.
- **Performance:** Optimized for speed and smooth interactions across devices.
- **Accessibility:** Designed to be usable by everyone, following best accessibility practices.
- **Responsiveness:** Fully responsive layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Personal Branding:** Custom fonts (VT323 for headings, clean Sans for body) and a cohesive color palette to reflect my personality and professionalism.
- **Content:** Clear sections for About, Projects, Skills, Experience, and Contact.
- **Open Source:** Codebase structured for maintainability and future growth.
